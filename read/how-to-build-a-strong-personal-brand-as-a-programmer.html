                            <h2>1. Define your niche and value proposition</h2>
                            <p>The first step to building a strong personal brand as a programmer is to define your niche and value proposition. Your niche is the specific area or domain of programming that you specialize in or are passionate about. Your value proposition is the unique value or benefit that you can offer to your target audience or market.</p>
                            <p>To define your niche and value proposition, you should consider these questions:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>What are your skills and strengths as a programmer?</strong> You should identify the programming languages, frameworks, tools, or technologies that you are proficient in or enjoy using. You should also identify the types of projects or problems that you are good at solving or creating.</li>
                            <li><strong>What are your interests and passions as a programmer?</strong> You should identify the topics, themes, or domains that you are curious about or excited about.
