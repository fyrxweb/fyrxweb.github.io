                                    or affected by your digital marketing efforts.
                                    You should also solicit

                                    and suggestions regarding your digital marketing goals

                            <p>The second step to creating a successful digital marketing strategy is to identify your
                                target audience and buyer personas. Your target audience is the group of people or
                                organizations that can benefit from your products or services. Your buyer personas are
                                the semi-fictional representations of your ideal customers or clients based on their
                                demographics, psychographics, needs, problems, etc.</p>
                            <p>To identify your target audience
                                and buyer personas,

                                and methods:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Data and analytics:</strong> You should use data
                                    and analytics from your existing
                                    and potential customers

                                    such as website visitors,
                                    email subscribers,
                                    social media followers,

                                    You should also use data
                                    and analytics from your competitors'
                                    and influencers'
                                    audiences
                                    and strategies

                                    and opportunities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Surveys and interviews:</strong> You should use surveys
                                    and interviews to collect
                                    and analyze qualitative
                                    and quantitative data
                                    and information from your existing

                                <li><strong>Persona creation:</strong> You should use persona creation to create
                                    and describe your buyer personas
                                    based on the data
                                    and information that you collect
                                    and analyze from your target audience.
                                    You should also use persona creation to create
                                    and describe your buyer journey,
                                    which is the process that your buyer personas go through
                                    from becoming aware of your products
                                    or services
                                    to becoming loyal customers

                            </ul>

                                master various aspects of digital marketing, such as website design, SEO, PPC, email
                                marketing, content marketing, social media marketing, etc.</p>
