                            <p>Networking is the process of building and maintaining relationships with people who can
                                help you achieve your personal and professional goals. Networking is one of the most
                                essential and powerful skills for business success, as it can help you access
                                opportunities, resources, information, and support that can boost your career and
                                business growth.</p>
                            <p>However, networking is not as easy as it sounds. Many people struggle with networking, as
                                they find it awkward, intimidating, or ineffective. They also face various challenges
                                and obstacles in networking, such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Lack of confidence and skills:</strong> Many people lack the confidence and
                                    skills to network effectively. They may feel nervous, shy, or insecure about
                                    approaching or talking to strangers. They may also lack the skills to communicate,
                                    connect, and follow up with their contacts.</li>
